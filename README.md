# DRSN
Official implementation of "Dynamic Recurrent Self-refinement Network for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution"

### Dependencies and Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hgpftd/DRSN.git
cd DRSN

conda create -n drsn python=3.9 -y
conda activate drsn

pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Preparations of dataset
We employ three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets in our experiments: Houston, Chikusei, and Pavia Centre. All datasets can be downloaded from their official websites listed below:
1,[Houston](https://naotoyokoya.com/Download.html)    
2,[Chikusei](https://naotoyokoya.com/Download.html)   
3,[Pavia centre](https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes)
